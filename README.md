# SVG2CSS

Complex CSS animation have always been a problem when it comes to implementation. It is really difficult for a programmar to create all the `@keyframes` related to a particular animation manually, and it is even more difficult to create `@keyframes` that use multiple `properties`. This *open source web app* solves the problem of complex css animations by providing very simple and easy to use user interface. The user/programmar simply needs to know how the animation should work.

### TODO
